<li>Macchiato, meaning "stained", is an espresso with a dash of foamed milk.</li><br><li> At first sight it resembles a small cappuccino, but even if the ingredients are the same as those used for cappuccino, a macchiato has a much stronger and aromatic taste.</li><br><li> The milk is foamed directly into the espresso cup, which is then put under the coffee outlet. </li><br><li>The espresso is then drawn into the cup.</li><br><li> Cocoa is sometimes sprinkled over the drink.</li><br><li>Often the process is reversed and milk foam is floated on top of extracted coffee.</li><br><li> A long macchiato will have two shots of espresso and a small amount of hot water (as per long black).</li><br><li> A short macchiato will usually have one shot of coffee and less water (as per short black).</li>
